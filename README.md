# Whiskey Sour and simple syrup
*I recommend using Jameson Triple Distilled Irish Whiskey, but any whiskey without smoky tones works. For a non-alcoholic version, the whiskey can be replaced by a teaspoon of vanilla extract and some water. The instructions also call for a shaker, but a shaker can be replaced by e.g. a plastic container with a lid.*

## Simple syrup

* 1 dl (or 1/2 cup) sugar
* 1 dl (or 1/2 cup) water

1. Put sugar and water in a pot.
2. Bring to boil to dissolve the sugar.
You are done. Simple syrup can be stored in the fridge forever.

## Whiskey Sour
* 2 parts whiskey (4 cl or 1.5 fluid ounces of whiskey will make one drink)
* 1 part lemon juice
* 1 part simple syrup
* ice

1. Put a few pieces of ice in a shaker. Measure up all ingredients in the shaker. Shake vigorously.
2. Put a few pieces of ice in a glass. Strain contents of shaker into the glass.
