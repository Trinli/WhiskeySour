# Whiskey Sour and simple syrup
To make a whiskey sour you will need whiskey, simple syrup, lemon juice, and ice.
I recommend using Jameson Triple Distilled Irish Whiskey, but any whiskey without
smoky tones works. The instructions also call for a shaker, but a shaker can be
replaced by e.g. a plastic container with a lid.

## Simple syrup

* 1 dl (or 1/2 cup) sugar
* 1 dl (or 1/2 cup) water

1. Put sugar and water in pot. The kind of pot that can contain a liquid.
2. Bring to boil to dissolve the sugar.
You are done. You have simple syrup. Simple syrup can be stored in the fridge forever.

## Whiskey Sour
* 2 parts whiskey (4 cl or 1,5 fluid ounces of whiskey will make one drink with this recipe)
* 1 part lemon juice
* 1 part simple syrup
* ice

1. Put a few pieces of ice in a shaker. Measure up all ingredients in the shaker. Shake vigorously.
2. Put a few pieces of ice in a glass. Strain contents of shaker and pour in the glass.
