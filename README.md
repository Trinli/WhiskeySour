# Whiskey Sour and simple syrup
To make a whiskey sour you will need simple syrup, lemon juice, whiskey, or ice.


## Simple syrup
As the name indicates, there is something very simple about this syrup. 
It consists of equal volumes of sugar and water.

SI-units:
1 dl sugar
1 dl water

For the ones of you that think body parts and random kitchen utensils are suitable units of measurement:
1 cup sugar
1 cup water

Put sugar and water in pot. The kind of pot that can contain a liquid. Put pot on stove. Bring to boil. Voil√†. You are done. You have simple syrup. Simple syrup can be stored in the fridge forever.

## Whiskey Sour
2 parts whiskey
1 part lemon juice
1 part simple syrup
ice

My favorite whiskey for this drink is Jameson Triple Distilled Irish Whiskey, but
any whiskey without smoky tones will do. 4 cl (or 1,5 fluid ounces) of whiskey will
make one drink with this recipe.

Put a few pieces of ice in a shaker. If you do not have a shaker, any container with a lid will do,
although glass jars might shatter. Measure up all ingredients in the shaker. Shake vigorously.

Put a few pieces of ice in a glass. Strain contents of shaker and pour in the glass.
