# Whiskey Sour and simple syrup
To make a whiskey sour you will need simple syrup, lemon juice, whiskey, and ice.


## Simple syrup

* 1 dl sugar
* 1 dl water

Simple syrup consists of equal volumes of sugar and water. 
1. Put sugar and water in pot. The kind of pot that can contain a liquid.
2. Bring to boil. 
You are done. You have simple syrup. Simple syrup can be stored in the fridge forever.

## Whiskey Sour
* 2 parts whiskey (I recommend Jameson Triple Distilled Irish Whiskey, but any whiskey without smoky tones will do)
* 1 part lemon juice
* 1 part simple syrup
* ice

4 cl (or 1,5 fluid ounces) of whiskey will make one drink with this recipe.

1. Put a few pieces of ice in a shaker. If you do not have a shaker, any container with a lid will do,
although glass jars might shatter. Measure up all ingredients in the shaker. Shake vigorously.
2. Put a few pieces of ice in a glass. Strain contents of shaker and pour in the glass.
